# iTunes Search Web App

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for content within the iTunes Store and view the search results. The application is built using Node.js, Express, and Axios for making requests to the iTunes Search API.

## Features

- Users can enter a search term and select a media type (music or podcast).
- The application makes a request to the iTunes Search API to retrieve search results.
- Search results are displayed on the same page, showing the track name, artist name, and a link to view the content on the iTunes Store.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): Usually included with Node.js installation.
